"Redux reducers work just like the function you pass to Array.reduce! :) The thing they reduce is actions. They reduce a set of actions (over time) into a single state. The difference is that with Arrayâ€™s reduce it happens all at once, and with Redux, it happens over the lifetime of your running app."
